# Objective function for the RNA folding problem 
by *Ouhab ELKOUADI* and *Henes AMROUCHE*

The goal, using the following worflow, is to estimate the **Gibbs free energy**. Indeed it's on this measure that the **native folding** of a **RNA** chain is hold. We know that the native folding is associate with the lowest Gibbs free energy. 

The workflow is containing the following scripts, we advice to use python 3. Make sure to have all the packages from `requirements.txt` to use it.  

- `Ã¬nter_atomic_distances.py` + explication 
- `distances_calculator.py`
- `frequency_calculator.py`
- `scoring_values.py`
- `gibbs_free_energy.py`

## Installation
To get all the repository files : 
```
git clone https://github.com/HenessA/RNA_Folding_Project/tree/main

Then go to the directory that contain and check : 
```
cd RNA_Folding_Project
ls
```
