# Objective function for the RNA folding problem 
by Ouhab ELKOUADI and Henes AMROUCHE

The goal, using the following worflow, is to estimate the Gibbs free energy. Indeed it's on this measure that the native folding of a RNA chain is hold. We know that the native folding is associate with the lowest Gibbs free energy. 

The workflow is containing, the following scripts:
