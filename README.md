# Objective function for the RNA folding problem 
by Ouhab ELKOUADI and Henes AMROUCHE

The goal, using the following worflow, is to estimate the **Gibbs free energy**. Indeed it's on this measure that the **native folding** of a **RNA** chain is hold. We know that the native folding is associate with the lowest Gibbs free energy. 

The workflow is containing the following scripts, we advice to use python 3 : 

- `Ã¬nter_atomic_distances.py`
- `distances_calculator.py`
- `frequency_calculator.py`
- `scoring_values.py`
- `gibbs_free_energy.py`
